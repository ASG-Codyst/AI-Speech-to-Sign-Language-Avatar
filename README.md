# AI-Based Speech to Sign Language Avatar

This project demonstrates a prototype AI system that converts spoken language into sign language representations using a modular AI pipeline.

## Pipeline
Speech → Text → Gloss → Pose → Visualization

## Tools Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- OpenAI Whisper
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Description
The system transcribes speech from audio/video, converts the text into sign-friendly gloss format, and generates skeletal pose data for sign language visualization.

## Note
This is a research prototype developed for academic demonstration purposes.
